# Stuff

# Palindrome Checker
- checks if a given String is a Palindrome

# Homogenity Calculator
- calculates how homogen different Arrays are
- its based on an arithmetic scale that reaches from 0 to 1 so the output can be read as %
- it only calculates the homogenity of the values, not the order of the values

so: [1, 2, 3] & [3, 2, 1] would be 100% homogen
